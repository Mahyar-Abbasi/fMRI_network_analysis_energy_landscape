# fMRI_network_analysis_phase_transition

In this research collaboration, under the supervision of Prof. Reza Jafari, we aimed to investigate network disorder
 and entropy in the dynamical network configurations of subjects with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and Autism (data sourced
 from open datasets including ABIDE). Utilizing phase transition theory and the Boltzmann Machine algorithm, we
 plotted phase diagrams based on brain states: normal and autistic. This investigation stems
 from the Critical Brain Hypothesis, which posits that the normal brain operates near a phase transition point. However, we could not show that there is a critical point between these two states as we have not captured a significant difference between network energy between the two groups.
